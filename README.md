# cmsc389T-Project 5

My custom change for the webpage is to change the font colors on the page to give it a bit more color.
I'm not sure why my profile picture appears on the Github Pages site but not on TerpConnect.

The webpage can be access at :
1. https://amgcheng.github.io/
2. https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~amgcheng/amgcheng.github.io/
